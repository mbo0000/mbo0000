## Hi there, üëã

My name is Minh Bo. I am currently working as an Operation Coordinator for a self driving(AKA. autonomous) vehicle company in San Francisco, CA. With many curiosities, I enjoy exploring and answering questions both in my professional and personal lives through the use of data. 


### Analytic Toolbox: üß∞üõ†Ô∏è

### Personal Projects üìÇ: 
- [**Data Analyst Top Skills**](https://github.com/mbo0000/Portfolio/tree/main/DataAnalyticTopSkills) by scrapping job postings for Entry-level Data Analyst in the SF Bay Areas through Linkedin and rank them. This one has been done to death by the data science community. However, I chose this topic as my first project since it is personal to me. 
- A quick [**Stack Overflow Analysis**](https://github.com/mbo0000/Portfolio/tree/main/StackoverflowAnalysis) with available data from BigQuery public dataset. I use Stack Overflow over a dozen times a day and would like to see how is the platform is doing from a business perspective.
