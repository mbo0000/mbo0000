## Hi there, üëã

My name is Minh Bo. I am currently working as an Operation Coordinator for a self driving(AKA. autonomous) vehicle company in San Francisco, CA. With many curiosities, I enjoy exploring and answering questions both in my professional and personal lives through the use of data. 


### My top tools use in both professional and personal projects: üß∞üõ†Ô∏è
- **SQL** for accessing and handling data from a dedicated data server. 
- **Google Sheet** and **Excel** for quick analysis, data wrangling and other automated tasks through Google API services.  
- **Python** prefered choice of tool for mid to heavy lifting projects. Ranging from data mining to a complete EDA project.  
- **Javascript** for automating reports and creating various tools/processes by using Google API services. 
- **Tableau** is a preferred tool when tackling a comprehensive data visualization project. 

### Personal Portfolio on topics of interest üìÇ:

- [**Web Scrapping**](https://github.com/mbo0000/Portfolio/tree/main/PythonWebscraping) for job posting for Entry-level Data Analyst in the SF Bay Areas through Linkedin.
