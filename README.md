## Hi there, 👋

My name is Minh Bo. I am currently working as an Operation Coordinator for a self driving(AKA. autonomous) vehicle company in San Francisco, CA. With many curiosities, I enjoy exploring and answering questions both in my professional and personal lives through the use of data. 


### My top tools use in both professional and personal projects: 🧰🛠️
